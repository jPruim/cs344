a)
Person correlation coefficient: is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. According to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality it has a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation. It is widely used in the sciences.

b)
I chose median income and rooms per person as they seemed to be the only corraleted data values.

to edit the lattitude:

def edit(df):
    newDF = pd.DataFrame()
    newDF["relative_latt_to_38] = df[lattitude].apply(lamda x: max(x-38,38-x) )
    newDF["median_income"] = df["median_income"]
    return newDF
