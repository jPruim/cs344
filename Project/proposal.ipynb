        "For the final project, I plan on creating a program that takes music data, and learns to approximate the next notes based on the previous notes, and then will be able to compose a piece of music. I am planning on using the Music Net database found here: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/musicnet.html\n",

        "To do this modeling, I hope to use an LSTM model. This type of model is specifically designed to be able to take past inputs and use them to predict the next value in a \"sliding window\" of inputs. Ideally, once the model is trained on the dataset, the user can input the first few notes, and generate a song. As of now, I am currently unsure of how the final output will be turned into playable audio or score music, but I believe I can figure something out."
