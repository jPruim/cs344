# Linear Algebra Networks

Linear Algebra Networks is implemented in Python. It uses NumPy to create matrices of arbitrary sized (analysis done on 7x7) square matrices. Then uses Keras to create different neural networks. The matrices used for data sets are created in the code through numpy and random values. They are then normalized to have each element be bound between 1 and -1.

To run, simply open file in python (with the packages installed) and run in order.

Note: the train_set, train_set2, and train_set3 all have the same data, but they each have a different shape. This is used to feed the data into different types of neural networks (i.e. CNN and simple).
