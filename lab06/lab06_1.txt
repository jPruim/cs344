Compute the information gain provided by the “Hungry?“ question from the restaurant domain. Use this restaurant data (AIMA, Figure 18.3). Would this question be better than either of the questions discussed in class (i.e., “Patrons?”, “Type?”?

Hungry:
Yes:7
    Wait?
        Y:5
        N:2

    Entropy =  -( 5/7*ln(5/7)+2/7*ln(2/7) ) =0.598
No:5
    Wait?
        Y:1
        N:4
    
    Entropy = - ( 1/5 * ln(1/5)+ 4/5*ln(4/5)) = 0.5

Avg Entropy after Hungry:
    7/12*0.598+5/12*0.5 = 0.557
Entropy before is 1 (perfectly balanced boolean)
thus Gain = 1-0.557 = 0.443

Info gain from patrons is .541

Thus Patrons does better at approaching the required information faster (will wait).
However, Type gives no information about the situation. Thus, the Gain = 0. And therefore anything (including hungry) is atleast as good of a question.
